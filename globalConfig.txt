As in dev environment nodemon is handling my nodejs server. So I can manage my Global Environment 
Variables with its nodemon.json file.
It is needed because if some pass or secret key changes and my app is already deployed then i have to 
change my source code for just changing a config and re-deploy it.

This situation can be handled more elegantly by using GLOBAL SETTINGS "Environment Variables".
Every hosting providers for node.js apps gives us a feature to inject Global Variables in running Node program.

For Nodejs these Global Variable are injected into the running node process and there I can access them
on a special object (process.env) holds all injected environment variables.
So I can access like: process.env.JWT_KEY

So for development I can use Node Environment Variables feature
and mentioned these Global Variables in nodemon.json config file.
