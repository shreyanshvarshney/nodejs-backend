Their is a NPM Package for managing and  storing configuration settings of my app and 
overwritting those settings in each environments.

For eg. In development environment I want to use different database or mail server

This package gives me a very clean structure for defining cofigs of all my environments.

For this i will use npm cofig package, installing it by (npm i config)

mkdir config
cd config
touch default.json

default.json:
{
    "name": "Name of my app"
}

development.json:
In this file i can define settings specific to my dev environment
I can also overwrite the properties defined in default.json and define new properties also.
{
    "name": "Name of my app - development",
    "mail": {
        "host":"dev-mail-server"
    }
    "port": 300
}

Now if my app.get("env") === "development", development.json will be taken into consideration

production.json:
{
    "name": "Name of my app - production",
    "mail": {
        "host":"prod-mail-server"
    }
}

if my app.get("env") === "production", production.json will be taken into consideration

Try by changing env variable (export NODE_ENV=production/development)

******** However I should not set my app secrets(pass of db, server) in these configuration files *******
Because this file will go to my source code repo.

So for app secrets, Store them in ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES:
For eg. export myapp_password=1234
In dev I set these env variables manually.
But in production env we have a interface to set these env variables for my app. (Like in aws elastic beanstalk/ec2)

** And read them using config module I have installed
For reading my custom created env variables I have to create a json file name exactly like this
Inside config folder => "custom-environment-variables.json"
In this file I will define the MAPPINGS of configuration settings to environment variables.

Run this in cli first:
export myapp_password=1234

custom-environment-variables.json
{
    "mail": {
        "password": "myapp_password"
    }
}

In this file i will only have the new setting/property which I want to set.
